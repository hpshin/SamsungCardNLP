This model achives our best perplexity yet, ~27 compared to ~34 for the previous model.\n",

        "As a reminder, here is the general encoder-decoder model:\n",

        "\n",
        "In the previous model, our architecture was set-up in a way to reduce \"information compression\" by explicitly passing the context vector, $z$, to the decoder at every time-step and by passing both the context vector and embedded input word, $d(y_t)$, along with the hidden state, $s_t$, to the linear layer, $f$, to make a prediction.\n",

It uses *attention*. \n",
        "\n",
        "Attention works by first, calculating an attention vector, $a$, that is the length of the source sentence. The attention vector has the property that each element is between 0 and 1, and the entire vector sums to 1. We then calculate a weighted sum of our source sentence hidden states, $H$, to get a weighted source vector, $w$. \n",
