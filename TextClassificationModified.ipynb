With a lot of layers, the learned patterns become and more complicated: from lines in the early layers to very complicated patterns (e.g., the whole cat or dog) on the upper ones. You can look at the examples in the [Analysis and Interpretability](#analysis_interpretability) section.\n",

Then there are some words and phrases which could be very informative \"clues\" (e.g. **it's been great**, **bored to death**, **absolutely amazing**, **the best ever**, etc), and others which are not important at all. We don't care much where in a text we saw **bored to death** to understand the sentiment, right?\n",

    "\n",
    "Mean-pooling works similarly but computes mean over each feature instead of maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### • Pooling and Global Pooling\n",

Specifically, after the convolution, we use global-over-time pooling. This is the key operation: it allows to compress a text into a single vector. The model itself can be different, but at some point it has to use the global pooling to compress input in a single vector.\n",

    "* take pretrained (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc) and fix them (use them as static vectors),\n",
    "* initialize with pretrained embeddings and train them with the network (\"fine-tune\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about these options by looking at the data a model can use. Training data for classification is labeled and task-specific, but labeled data is usually hard to get. Therefore, this corpus is likely to be not huge (at the very least), or not diverse, or both. On the contrary, training data for word embeddings is not labeled - plain texts are enough. Therefore, these datasets can be huge and diverse - a lot to learn from.\n",

    "Now let us think what a model will know depending on what we do with the embeddings. If the embeddings are trained from scratch, the model will \"know\" only the classification data - this may not be enough to learn relationships between words well. But if we use pretrained embeddings, they (and, therefore, the whole model) will know a huge corpus - they will learn a lot about the world. To adapt these embeddings to your task-specific data, you can fine-tune these embeddings by training them with the whole network - this can bring gains in the performance (not huge though).\n",

    "Data augmentation alters your dataset in different ways to get alternative versions of the same training example. Data augmentation can increase\n",
    "\n",
    "* the amount of data  \n",

    "    By giving different versions of training examples, you teach a model to be more robust to real-world data which can be of lower quality or simply a bit different from your training data. With augmented data, a model is less likely to overfit to specific types of training examples and will rely more on general patterns.\n",

    "#### • word dropout \\- the most simple and popular\n",
    "\n",
    "Word dropout is the simplest regularization: for each example, you choose some words randomly (say, each word is chosen with probability 10%) and replace the chosen words with either the special token **UNK** or with a random token from the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://lena-voita.github.io/resources/lectures/text_clf/practical_tips/word_dropout-min.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation here is simple: we teach a model not to over-rely on individual tokens, but take into consideration context of the whole text. For example, here we masked **great**, and a model has to understand the sentiment based on other words.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://lena-voita.github.io/resources/lectures/text_clf/practical_tips/cat_dropout-min.png\" width=\"30%\" align=\"right\">\n",
    "Note: For images, this corresponds to masking out some areas. By masking out an area of an image, we also want a model not to over-rely on local features and to make use of a more global context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### • use external resources (e.g., thesaurus) \\- a bit more complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit more complicated approach is to replace words or phrases with their synonyms. The tricky part is getting these synonyms: you need external resources, and they are rarely available for languages other than English (for English, you can use e.g. WordNet). Another problem is that for languages with rich morphology (e.g., Russian) you are likely to violate the grammatical agreement.\n",

    "#### • use separate models \\- even more complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "An even more complicated method is to paraphrase the whole sentences using external models. A popular paraphrasing method is to translate a sentence to some language and back. We will learn how to train a translation model a bit later (in the [Seq2seq and Attention](../nlp_course.html#preview_seq2seq_attn) lecture), but for now, you can use industrial systems, e.g. [Yandex Translate](https://translate.yandex.com), [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com), etc. (Lena: Obviously, personally I'm biased towards Yandex :) ) Note that you can combine translation systems and languages to get several paraphrases.\n",

    "Convolutions were originally developed for images, and there's already a pretty good understanding of what the filters capture and how filters from different layers from a hierarchy.

    "* convolving filters are used as ngram detectors  \n",
    "    Each filter specializes in one or several families of closely-related ngrams. Filters are not homogeneous, i.e. a single filter can, and often does, detect multiple distinctly different families of ngrams.\n",
    "* max-pooling induces a thresholding behavior  \n",
    "    Values below a given threshold are ignored when (i.e. irrelevant to) making a prediction. For example, [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08037.pdf) shows that 40% of the pooled ngrams on average can be dropped with no loss of performance.\n",
